I decided to really learn pygame that I wanted to start very basic and
develop from there. So right now that means pong. This isn't meant to be a 
complete remake of pong, nor is it the best version out there. This simply
exists to get more practice with pygame, so that both my knowledge of it as
well as general game design improves.

If you want to play this make sure you have python and pygame, and then just
run jamilpong.py as you would any other python program.

Thank you,
